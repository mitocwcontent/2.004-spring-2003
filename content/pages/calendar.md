| 6-9 | Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies | Combined translation and rotation of rigid body; angular velocity; generalized coordinates; common constraints. Kinetic energy of rigid body. |
| 10-15 | Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies | Linear and angular momentum principles for systems including rigid bodies; derivingequations of motion using momentum principles; conservation of energy; linearization in the neighbourhood of equilibrium, stability and instability; rolling cylinder inside rollinghoop; inverted pendulum on cart. |
| 16-18 | Vibrations of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems | Natural modes and the eigenvalue problem; free and forced response to harmonic excitation; damping effects; Bode plots. |
| 19-24 | Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies | Actuators, sensors; P, D, I feedback-loop strategies; root-locus design; application to inverted pendulum on cart, automatic self-balancing scale; frequency-domain design methods, gain margin, phase margin.
